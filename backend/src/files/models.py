Lab
A key part of the learning in this course is the hands-on programming labs. The scheduled lab time will
provide time to work on and receive TA help on the lab exercises. There are 5 labs which must be completed
individually. The weighting of the labs are as follows:

Project
The project in this course will require students to implement a major piece of software that makes use of
the material of the course to develop a deep learning application. It is a substantial focus of the second half
of this course. The project will be done in teams of four, and will account for 40% of your final grade.
There are several phases and specific deadlines of the project, with several interim deliverable due dates, a
preliminary schedule follows:

Late Work Policy
Late submissions will be accepted up to 24 hours past the deadline with a 20% grade deduction. Quercus
submission time will be used, not your local computer time. You can submit your labs as many times as you
want before the deadline, so please submit often and early. No other late work will be accepted, however,
we will consider exceptional cases on a case-by-case basis, such as with a doctorâ€™s note in the case of illness.
